Dashboard App that turns a raspberry pi and a tv into a useful application


# Todo:
 - YAML configuration 
     - YAML layout
     - Allow more display resolutions
     - Landscape vs portrait orientation
 - Change to a plugin based system, register now plugins, only load config when needed
 - Extend graphing engine used in crypto to be more generic
 - Rotating display based on time (10 secs dashboard, 10 secs price graph)
 - Have the image system download higer resolution images and resize/crop to the screen as needed
 - Test/confirm dark vs light text and image colors
 - Download free fonts from internet and store in local cache instead of hardcoded fonts
 - cache the weather icons instead of re-downloading them each time
 - ~~Move all images downloads to temp files that cleanup after themselves~~
 
 
# Ideas:
 - Download and sync images from google drive/dropbox/i-cloud folder and scan/rotate them  
 - Reduce the bar to get up and running
    - Prebuilt raspbian image
    - WYSIWYG config editor? pygame drag and drop?
