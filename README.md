Dashboard App that turns a raspberry pi and a tv into a useful application


# Todo:
 - YAML configuration 
     - YAML layout
     - Allow more display resolutions
     - Landscape vs portrait orientation
 - Move all images downloads to temp files that cleanup after themselves
 - Change to a plugin based system, register now plugins, only load config when needed
 - Extend graphing engine used in crypto to be more generic
 - Rotating display based on time (10 secs dashboard, 10 secs price graph)
 
 
# Ideas:
 - Download and sync images from google drive/dropbox/i-cloud folder and scan/rotate them
